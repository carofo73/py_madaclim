# Bioclimatic variables definition
bio1:
  name: "bio1"
  longname: "Annual Mean Temperature"
  unit: "Celcius"
  filename: "wc2.1_30s_bio_1.tif"
  explanation: "The mean of all the weekly mean temperatures. Each weekly mean temperature is the mean of the weekly maximum and minimum temperatures over the whole year."
bio2:
  name: "bio2"
  longname: "Mean Diurnal Range(Mean(period max-min)"
  unit: "Celcius"
  filename: "wc2.1_30s_bio_2.tif"
  explanation: "The mean over the whole year of the weekly diurnal temperature ranges. Each weekly diurnal range is the difference between that week's maximum and minimum temperature. "
bio3:
  name: "bio3"
  longname: "Isothermality 2/7"
  unit: "Celcius"
  filename: "wc2.1_30s_bio_3.tif"
  explanation: "The mean diurnal range (parameter bio2) divided by the Annual Temperature Range (parameter bio7)."
bio4:
  name: "bio4"
  longname: "Temperature Seasonality (C of V)"
  unit: "Celcius/100"
  filename: "wc2.1_30s_bio_4.tif"
  explanation : "The temperature Coefficient of Variation (C of V) is the standard deviation of the weekly mean temperatures expressed as a percentage of the mean of those temperatures. For this calculation, the mean in degrees Kelvin is used. This avoids the possibility o f having to divide by zero, but it does mean that the values are usually quite small."
bio5:
  name: "bio5"
  longname: "Max Temperature of Warmest Period"
  unit: "Celcius"
  filename: "wc2.1_30s_bio_5.tif"
  explanation : "The highest maximum temperature in all weeks of the year."
bio6:
  name: "bio6"
  longname: "Min Temperature of Coldest Period"
  unit: "Celcius"
  filename: "wc2.1_30s_bio_6.tif"
  explanation : "The lowest minimum temperature in all weeks of the year."
bio7:
  name: "bio7"
  longname: "Temperature Annual Range (5-6)"
  unit: "Celcius"
  filename: "wc2.1_30s_bio_7.tif"
  explanation : "The difference between the Max Temperature of Warmest Period and the Min Temperature of Coldest Period."
bio8:
  name: "bio8"
  longname: "Temperature Annual Range (5-6)"
  unit: "Celcius"
  filename: "wc2.1_30s_bio_8.tif"
  explanation : "The wettest quarter of the year is determined (to the nearest week), and the mean temperature of this period is calculated. "
bio9:
  name: "bio9"
  longname: "Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter"
  unit: "Celcius"
  filename: "wc2.1_30s_bio_9.tif"
  explanation : "The driest quarter of the year is determined (to the nearest week), and the mean temperature of this period is calculated."
bio10:
  name: "bio10"
  longname: "Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter"
  unit: "Celcius"
  filename: "wc2.1_30s_bio_10.tif"
  explanation : "The warmest quarter of the year is determined (to the nearest week), and the mean temperature of this period is calculated."
bio11:
  name: "bio11"
  longname: "Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter"  
  unit: "Celcius"
  filename: "wc2.1_30s_bio_11.tif"
  explanation : "The coldest quarter of the year is determined (to the nearest week), and the mean temperature of this period is calculated."
bio12:
  name: "bio12"
  longname: "Annual Precipitation"
  unit: "kg / m**2 / year"
  filename: "wc2.1_30s_bio_12.tif"
  explanation : "The sum of all 12 monthly precipitation estimates."
bio13:
  name: "bio13"
  longname: "Precipitation of Wettest Period"
  unit: "kg / m**2 / month"

  longname: "Precipitation of Driest Period"
  unit: "kg / m**2 / month"
  filename: "wc2.1_30s_bio_14.tif"
  explanation : "The precipitation of the driest week or month, depending on the time step."
bio15:
  name: "bio15"
  longname: "Precipitation Seasonality(C of V)"
  unit: "kg / m**2"
  filename: "wc2.1_30s_bio_15.tif"
  explanation : "The Coefficient of Variation (C of V) is the standard deviation of the weekly precipitation estimates expressed as a percentage of the mean of those estimates."
bio16:
  name: "bio16"
  longname: "Precipitation of Wettest Quarter"
  unit: "kg / m**2 / month"
